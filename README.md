# Statistical_Study_on_pokemon
This repository contains my statistical study on Pokemon data and how they are related and different from one generation to another.


The first episode of anime was released 1st of April 1997 and since then Pokémon have been all time favorites for everyone. Since then there has been a total of 1020 main series episodes, 8 TV specials (3 full-length, 5 normal-length), 25 side-story episodes,7 Winter Vacation shorts,8 ANA flights shorts, 20 movies and numerous games have been released. It is the only anime know by many people and is famous all around the world. There are more than 800 types of Pokémon made till now and have a lot of different stats and functions. For the project, we will be discussing the first 721 Pokémon we have and try to analysis the outliers in the Attack power of Pokémon VS the Defense power of the Pokémon. Furthermore, we will also analyze similarities in the generations of Pokémon (There is a total of 8 generations of Pokémon and each generation have its own new starter Pokémon along with different type of stats in every one of them.) For this project, we will be only considering till generation 6 as we only have data till that generation. Further, Considering the whole data, we will discuss the total stat of the Pokémon and try to see the nature of the graph and how it is changing in different places along with why it shows that type of nature.
